[Problem 121](http://projecteuler.net/problem=121)

I started by drawing out the example case, with 4 rounds of drawing discs.

Noting that many combinations of draws lead to the same state in the number of discs posessed, I figured I could determine the probability of arriving at any given state by summing the probabilities of previous states and factoring in the latest two ways of arriving to the state. In other words, this problem appeared to lend itself to a solution via [dynamic programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming).

Essentially, taking the upper-left corner to have a probability of arrival of 1.0, any other cell in the triangle can be computed by summing the value of the following two items:

* The probability of having arrived at the cell directly above, times the inverse of one more than the current row number. (This is the chance of having drawn the blue disc from among the reds.)
* The probability of having arrived at the cell diagonally above and left, times the ratio of the current row number to one more than the current row number. (This is the chance of having drawn a red.)

Any position in the triangle can be quantified by (x - 1, y - 1), where x is the round number, and y is the number of red discs drawn.

From this, we conclude if we sum the first `#rounds / 2` values in the final row, we will have the probability of winning (drawing more blue discs than red). The inverse of this value is the break-even point. Since we're dealing with whole numbers of currency units, and there's an initial buy-in of one, the highest safe amount that can be used as a prize pool is the ceiling of the inverse of that sum, minus one.
